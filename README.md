# Tungsten

An easily embeddable scripting language for Zig.

It takes inspiration from several languages I've used, and attempts to combine all the best ideas from each into a mostly sensible language. I will try my best to provide ample documentation and keep the language simple and easy to understand.

## ⚠️ Here Be Dragons! ⚠️

Just about nothing interesting is implemented at the moment, and there's no easy way to use the very little amount that is. I would ignore this project entirely for a while if I were you.
